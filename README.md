# revergo

Reversi implementation in Go for educational purposes (AI algorithms, golang, testing, simulations).

## TODO

- Board
    - [x] determine valid moves
    - [x] apply player's move
    - [x] calculate outcome
    - [x] render board as string
- Players
    - [x] `STDIN` Player: Plays interactively from `STDIN`.
    - [x] Random Player: Picks a random move for every round.
    - [x] Corner Player: Goes for corners first, then for a random move.
    - [x] Corner/Edge Player: Goes for corners first, then for edges, then for a random move.
    - [x] Minimax Player: Applies Minimax algorithm (concurrently) with a limited step.
    - [ ] other ideas: Minimax player with corner strategy, â€¦
- Modes
    - [x] Simulation with two players, playing a lot of rounds against one another
    - [x] Tournament with multiple players, playing against each other twice (first and second leg)

## League

Run a league with 15 rounds (all players play 30 rounds against one another
with colors mixed in order to ensure there's no first mover advantage):

    $ go run league/league.go -n 15

Run a league with only two rounds, but with additional minimax players with
deeper recursion levels:

## Interactive Play

Run a game against the computer (from `stdin`; pick an opponent by modifying the source code):

    go run simulation/simulation.go
